# Blocsummer statistics

## Statistics

Per day statistics: Each day in the night a set of graphs is generated into directory %Y-%m-%d. Old are based on data of previous day.

## Data 

In addition to statistics, the base data is stored alongside the graphs.

## Code

Very ugly python script analyze.py to generate the statistics.
